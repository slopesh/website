It's built to work exactly how you'd hope: drag, drop, link, done. Pretty much everything is engineered for speed. If something breaks, I patch it. If an upload's slow, I upgrade the pipes.",

Cloudflare shields it from weird traffic, and there's real attention to uptime. Bugs get squashed as soon as they pop up—no waiting for \"the next release.\"",
                            "Users? Everyone from students, modders, server owners, teachers, random gamers, all passing stuff around when Discord starts complaining about file sizes. Honestly, if you use it, you're probably the reason half the new features exist—I just ship what people ask for if it makes sense and it's doable.",
                            "There's no story about \"disrupting the cloud\" or \"revolutionizing sharing.\" It's just a tool that's always getting tuned up and pushed forward—no drama, no \"roadmaps,\" just stuff that works. If you want a place to toss files around with zero friction, welcome aboard."
